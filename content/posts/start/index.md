Why would one start a blog in 2024? Isn't that about 10 years too late? Well,
yeah...

There is more than one way to keep in touch with the development of the
community and the ecosystem of interoperable tools for distributed data
management that the DataLad software is a part of. [Joey's git-annex dev
blog](https://git-annex.branchable.com/devblog) has been around for a decade at
this point. The [DataLad handbook](https://handbook.datalad.org) was first
released five years ago. It is not only an introduction to DataLad, but
contains more than a few contributed examples of using git-annex, DataLad and
other tools in unison to solve data challenges, mostly focused on research.  We
posted bits on social media since the beginning. First on the
platform that is no longer, and more recently on
[Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@datalad). And this year, we finally had a
proper community meet-up at [Distribits](https://distribits.live) in
DÃ¼sseldorf.

So why a(nother) blog now?

DataLad has matured and its community has diversified. Instead of one software
package, there are now many. Watching any single repo gives a very limited idea
of the overall progress made. Social media does not allow for the depth often
needed to explain and demo things properly. The handbook is both too voluminous
and too research focused, to be a good place to put everything worth
showcasing. And the [talks at
Distribits](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEQHbPfpVqU6esVrgqjfYybY394XD2qf2)
have proven that there is a lot of amazing stuff that people do with DataLad.

So why not?

This blog aims to be a place to share thoughts and facts in the realm of
distributed data and DataLad. Short or long pieces on new developments, custom
solutions to large or small challenges, or opinions about the way things ought
to be, or not. And as with all the other aspects about DataLad, it is open for
contributions. The [blog website](https://blog.datalad.org) is generated from
[a DataLad dataset](https://github.com/datalad/blog) with
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io). If you are interested in contributing a post, [drop us
a note](mailto:team@datalad.org).
